        * version 1.3.2
        - solaris printf workaround. use %lu tu print filesizes. works
	  best on 64-bit architectures (with compilers assuming sizeof(long)
	  == sizeof(size_t)). GNU/Linux support %zu which is the appropriate
	  modifier for this case, but can't have it everywhere.
	- doesn't print directory infos into catalogues when creating sfvs
	- see other modifications since 1.3.1 (many of them)
	
2005-01-26  Heikki Orsila  <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- fixed output (displayed only 32-bit file sizes, and months wrong)
	  OLD:
	  ;    100663296  14:54.37 2005-00-25 zeros
	  NEW:
	  ;   4395630592  14:54.37 2005-01-25 zeros
	- lots of code cleanups
	- solaris fixes

	* no new version
        - Added and edited man page from Debian distribution
	- Fixed Makefile issues for -jx
	- Added a simple configure script for more consistent compilation
	- Removed b0rken rpm creation from Makefile
	- Removed spam messages (when creating and verifying checksums)
	- Added test cases (make tests)
	- added fake and lousy stdint.h generation (OS that don't have it
	  should be upgraded)

        * no new version
	- I decided to start maintaining the program since Bryan Call is
	  unreachable.

2004-05-25  Heikki Orsila  <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        * version 1.3.1
	- Fixed 64-bit issues. Went into Gentoo portage.

2000-12-28  Bryan Call  <bc@fodder.org>

	* version 1.3
	- Fixed the problem with ignoring case.  Lots of people have mentioned
	it (used the patch from Harold Gutch).
	- Now will compile on RedHat 7.1.

	* version 1.2
	- Fixed the a problem when making a new sfv it was not being zero
	padded (found by Justin Head and Andre Tertling).
	- Added the idea, when insensitive matching is activated, it will treat
	"_" and " " equal. For example it will treat "foo_bar.txt" and
	"Foo Bar.txt" the same (suggested and patch given by Andree Borrmann).
	- Made it so it will not choke on blank lines.
	
2000-05-18  Bryan Call  <bc@fodder.org>

	* version 1.1
	- Added verbose to the program.  Now the program will list what file it
	is working on and the status of the file.  When it is finished it will
	display a final result, if it encountered any errors or not, and it
	will print the bell character. You can turn this off with the -q option
	(quiet).
	- Moved some functions around a some other minor stuff.

2000-05-16  Bryan Call  <bc@fodder.org>

	* version 1.0
	- This is the first version that has been released for public
	consumption.  Hopefully, I have worked out most of the bugs. I have
	this working on FreeBSD 3.4 and Redhat 6.1 (i386).
