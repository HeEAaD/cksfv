	- A configure script bug was fixed that prevented inttypes.h from being
	  detected if stdint.h doesn't exist. It is possible that this bug
	  hasn't affected any system. Thanks go to Stefan Alfresson for
	  fixing this <alfs@debian.org>.
	- Added optimization into the configure script. Now inttypes.h is not
	  checked if stdint.h exists.

2005-06-07  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* version 1.3.5
	- recursive SFV checking support by Travis Poppe <tlp@liquidx.org>
	- portability fix for OpenBSD

2005-05-22  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* version 1.3.5-pre2
	- portable integer type #include fix for OpenBSD and possibly others.
	  thanks to Daniel Kåkneryd for pointing out the problem. (shd)

2005-05-12  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* version 1.3.5-pre1
	- (copied from 2005-05-11) feature that prints out sfv files with
	  broken files and broken
	  sfv files when recursive sfv checking is enabled. this is useful
	  because print out in recursive mode can be long. one sees those
	  sfv files that failed at the end of the output. Thanks to
	  Travis Poppe <tlp@liquidx.org> for suggesting this feature (shd)

        * version 1.3.4
	- compatibility fixes
	- recursive sfv file checking support by Durk van Veen
	  <durk.van.veen@gmail.com>

2005-03-26  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- trivial fix for 'make check'. It wasn't posix sh compatible.
	  On bash "==" is the same as "=".

2005-03-26  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* version 1.3.4-pre5
	- added recursion support from Durk van Veen <durk.van.veen@gmail.com>

2005-03-21  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- fixed 'make install' bug. Man dir was not created properly. Thanks
	  to Durk van Veen <durk.van.veen@gmail.com> for finding this.

2005-02-21  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* version 1.3.4-pre1
	- consistent policy for BSD and Linux systems. Trying to checksum a
	  directory lead to different actions. Also, trying to verify
	  checksum of a directory bugged.

2005-02-06  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        - 'make check' executes tests. 'make tests' doesn't.

2005-02-04  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* version 1.3.3
	- lots of changes. see previous changelog entries.

2005-02-04  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        - configure script now ignore unknown arguments (but gives a warning)
	- configure allows setting mandir and compiler. Examples:
	  --mandir=/usr/man
	  --compiler=/opt/experimental/gcc-4/bin/gcc
	- fixed wording in man file (Thomas Klausner)
	- -b option: print only basenames of the given files when creating
	  an sfv.

2005-02-03  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- fixed O_LARGEFILE for macosx
	- Thomas Klausner submitted partial sfv checking patch by Dieter Baron
	  <dillo@giga.or.at>. Now
	  cksfv -f foo.sfv [FILE1 FILE2 ...] checks only given FILES.
	- Thomas Klausner <tk@giga.or.at> submitted patch by Tobias Nygren
	  <tnn@netilium.org> to avoid calculating CRC twice per
	  file (read once, compute twice).

2005-02-03  Heikki Orsila  <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        * version 1.3.2
        - solaris printf workaround. use %lu tu print filesizes. works
	  best on 64-bit architectures (with compilers assuming sizeof(long)
	  == sizeof(size_t)). GNU/Linux support %zu which is the appropriate
	  modifier for this case, but can't have it everywhere.
	- doesn't print directory infos into catalogues when creating sfvs
	- see other modifications since 1.3.1 (many of them)
	
2005-01-26  Heikki Orsila  <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- fixed output (displayed only 32-bit file sizes, and months wrong)
	  OLD:
	  ;    100663296  14:54.37 2005-00-25 zeros
	  NEW:
	  ;   4395630592  14:54.37 2005-01-25 zeros
	- lots of code cleanups
	- solaris fixes
	
2005-01-25  Heikki Orsila  <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	* no new version
        - Added and edited man page from Debian distribution
	- Fixed Makefile issues for -jx
	- Added a simple configure script for more consistent compilation
	- Removed b0rken rpm creation from Makefile
	- Removed spam messages (when creating and verifying checksums)
	- Added test cases (make tests)
	- added fake and lousy stdint.h generation (OS that don't have it
	  should be upgraded)

2005-01-24  Heikki Orsila  <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        * no new version
	- I decided to start maintaining the program since Bryan Call is
	  unreachable.

2004-05-25  Heikki Orsila  <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
        * version 1.3.1
	- Fixed 64-bit issues. Went into Gentoo portage.

2000-12-28  Bryan Call  <bc@fodder.org>

	* version 1.3
	- Fixed the problem with ignoring case.  Lots of people have mentioned
	it (used the patch from Harold Gutch).
	- Now will compile on RedHat 7.1.
	
2000-12-28  Bryan Call  <bc@fodder.org>

	* version 1.2
	- Fixed the a problem when making a new sfv it was not being zero
	padded (found by Justin Head and Andre Tertling).
	- Added the idea, when insensitive matching is activated, it will treat
	"_" and " " equal. For example it will treat "foo_bar.txt" and
	"Foo Bar.txt" the same (suggested and patch given by Andree Borrmann).
	- Made it so it will not choke on blank lines.
	
2000-05-18  Bryan Call  <bc@fodder.org>

	* version 1.1
	- Added verbose to the program.  Now the program will list what file it
	is working on and the status of the file.  When it is finished it will
	display a final result, if it encountered any errors or not, and it
	will print the bell character. You can turn this off with the -q option
	(quiet).
	- Moved some functions around a some other minor stuff.

2000-05-16  Bryan Call  <bc@fodder.org>

	* version 1.0
	- This is the first version that has been released for public
	consumption.  Hopefully, I have worked out most of the bugs. I have
	this working on FreeBSD 3.4 and Redhat 6.1 (i386).
