        * no new version

	  unreachable.

	* version 1.2
	- Fixed the a problem when making a new sfv it was not being zero
	padded (found by Justin Head and Andre Tertling).
	- Added the idea, when insensitive matching is activated, it will treat
	"_" and " " equal. For example it will treat "foo_bar.txt" and
	"Foo Bar.txt" the same (suggested and patch given by Andree Borrmann).
	- Made it so it will not choke on blank lines.

	* version 1.1
	- Added verbose to the program.  Now the program will list what file it
	is working on and the status of the file.  When it is finished it will
	display a final result, if it encountered any errors or not, and it
	will print the bell character. You can turn this off with the -q option
	(quiet).
	- Moved some functions around a some other minor stuff.

	* version 1.0
	- This is the first version that has been released for public
	consumption.  Hopefully, I have worked out most of the bugs. I have
	this working on FreeBSD 3.4 and Redhat 6.1 (i386).
