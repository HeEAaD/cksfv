	* version 1.1
	- Added verbose to the program.  Now the program will list what file it
	is working on and the status of the file.  When it is finished it will
	display a final result, if it encountered any errors or not, and it
	will print the bell character. You can turn this off with the -q option
	(quiet).
	- Moved some functions around a some other minor stuff.

	* version 1.0
	- This is the first version that has been released for public
	consumption.  Hopefully, I have worked out most of the bugs. I have
	this working on FreeBSD 3.4 and Redhat 6.1 (i386).
