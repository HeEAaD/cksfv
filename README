cksfv (Check SFV) can create sfv (Simple File Verification) listings and test
already created sfv files.  Uses the crc32 checksum.

cksfv is pretty easy to use.  There are only three flags at the moment.  I
plan to add more options laters so there will be more to come.  The -i flag is
was added because there sometimes are .sfv files that have the file names
listed all in caps.  This options will add look in the directory for filenames
that match, not taking case into account (strcasecmp()).

Right now the files can only be access via http at
http://www.fodder.org/cksfv/.  I have a tarball and RPMs there.
