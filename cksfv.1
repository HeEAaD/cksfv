.SH NAME
cksfv \- tests and creates simple file verification (SFV) listings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cksfv
.I "[-bciqrL] [-C directory] [-f file.sfv] [file ...]"
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some files that you download will come with a .sfv file.
.BR cksfv
is used to
verify that the files that you received are the same as the originals.
cksfv is a program that can use the .sfv file to verify the downloaded
files.  Also, it can be used to create new .sfv files.
.PP
.BR md5sum
(1) or
.BR sha1sum
(1)
are the suggested ways of checksuming new files. cksfv should only
be used for compatibility with other systems.

.SH OPTIONS
These options are available
.TP
.B \-b
strip dirnames from filenames that are checksumed. loads the files from
original positions, but prints only basenames to catalogue in sfv file.
.TP
.B \-c
Use stdout for printing progress and final resolution (files OK or
some errors detected). This is useful for external programs analysing
output of cksfv. This also forces fflushes on the output when needed.
.TP
.B \-C
change to directory for processing
.B \-f
 .sfv file to verify
.TP
.B \-i
ignore case on filenames
.TP
.B \-q
quiet, only prints error messages
.TP
.B \-v
verbose, by default this option is on
.TP
.B \-r
recurse directories and check the .sfv files in each. This option
cannot be used in conjunction with the -f option.
.TP
.B \-L
follow symlinks when recursing subdirectories. This option only has
meaning when used in conjunction with the -r option.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
Check checksums of files listed in 'files.sfv':
.ft B
cksfv -f files.sfv

.ft R
Create checksums for a bunch of files:
.ft B
cksfv *.gz > files.sfv

.ft R
Check checksum of case-insensitive filenames listed in 'files.sfv'.
This is sometimes useful with files created by operating systems
that have case-insensitive filesystem names.
.ft B
cksfv -i -f files.sfv

.ft R
Check checksums of files 'foo' and 'bar' listed in 'files.sfv':
.ft B
cksfv -f files.sfv foo bar

.ft R
Create checksums of files matching /foo/bar/* and strip dirnames away:
.ft B
cksfv -b /foo/bar/* > files.sfv

.ft R
Recursively scan through a directory and subdirectories and process
each .sfv file that is found:
.ft B
cksfv -C /foo/bar -r

.ft R
Same as previous, but starting from the current working directory 
and also following symlinks during recursion:
.ft B
cksfv -r -L
